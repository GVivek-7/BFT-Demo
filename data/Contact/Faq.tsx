    ques: <>How does Blindfold Trip work?</>,
    ans: "Choose your journey type and share a few basics — time, comfort, and travel vibe. Our curators plan everything in secret. You’ll get hints before you go, and the destination is revealed only when it’s time to depart.",
  },

    ques: <>What should I pack if I don’t know where I’m going?</>,

    id: 4,
    ques: <>When will I find out my destination?</>,

    ques: <>What if I don’t like the weather or destination?</>,
